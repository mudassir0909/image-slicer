A common task I do for my Instagram https://instagram.com/pixelcop is to split my landscape photos into multiple slices of 4x5 images. I have been using Adobe Photoshop to split them. But being a programmer I've always been meaning to write a script to automate this. However, my procrastination would never let me finish the project, today I used ChatGPT to write a program to do the task including debugging errors that I had encountered. Here's the source code.

# image-slicer
Given input image filepath, N slices and aspect ratio, splits the image into N slices
